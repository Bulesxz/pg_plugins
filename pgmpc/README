pgmpc, mpd client for PostgreSQL
================================

This module includes a full interface to interact with a remote mpd server
from a PostgreSQL server.

The features included in this module permit to do the following operations
on an instance of mpd:
- Control player modes
- Control of volume
- Query status
- Query list of songs
- etc.

Installation
------------

This module requires libmpdclient to be installed, then it can be compiled
with the following command:

    make install

Options
-------

The following options can be used:
- pgmpc.mpd_host, address to connect to mpd instance. Default is "localhost"
This can be set as a local Unix socket.
- pgmpc.mpd_port, port to connect to mpd instance. Default is 6600.
- pgmpc.mpd_password, password to connect to mpd instance.
All those parameters can be updated using SET within a single session.

Note that as this module uses GIC parameters to control the connection
to the remote mpd server, that the following setting need to be added
in postgresql.conf:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'pgmpc'
