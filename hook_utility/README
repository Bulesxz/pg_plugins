hook_utility
============

This module uses a hook on utility commands to put restrictions on them.
In the particular case of this module, DROP DATABASE can only be executed
on a given database by a certain user. In order to enable this module in a
PostgreSQL instance, the following parameter needs to be set in
postgresql.conf after installing this module:

    shared_preload_libraries = 'hook_utility'

Options
-------

The following options are available:

- hook_utility.dbname, name of the database that can only be dropped by
a certain user, defined by hook_utility.username.
- hook_utility.username, name of the user that can drop the database defined
by hook_utility.dbname.

Notes
-----

More restrictions and more extensible options could be put in this small
utility that should be used only as a base of work.
