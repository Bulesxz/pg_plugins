pg_wal_blocks, tracker for relation blocks in WAL
=================================================

pg_wal_blocks is a binary utility aimed at parsing WAL records to tell
to users what is the list of blocks touched by WAL.

This module takes advantage of the refactoring of WAL that happened in
Postgres 9.5, and is compatible with this version and newer versions.

Installation
------------

Compiling pg_wal_blocks requires the PostgreSQL source tree to be available.
Pass the path to the PostgreSQL source tree to make, in the top_srcdir
variable:

    make top_srcdir=<path to PostgreSQL source tree>

In addition, pg_config must be in $PATH.

Usage
-----

pg_wal_blocks is rather simple to use, requiring only a WAL segment file
in input for simplicity:

    pg_wal_blocks <WAL segment>

This module could be extended with a bunch of fancy options, but for
the sake of simplicity this code is kept as-is.
