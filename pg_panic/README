pg_panic
========

Generate PANIC in a non-deterministic way based on a luck factor for
queries going through the planner (so as utility commands are out of
scope), meaning that OLTP applications are more likely to execute
a failure in a timely manner than data-warehouse type of applications
holding long transactions.

This is useful to test the robustness of an installation to somewhat
emulate failures that could happen at FS-level or OS-level as Postgres
is known to be a robust piece of software.

This module uses the following parameter:
- pg_panic.luck_factor, float with [0..1] as possible values, giving
the percentage of chance to execute a PANIC when executing one query.
When this factor is set to 1, all the queries will execute a failure.
When set to 0, no failures will happen. To emulate random failures it
is recommended to set it to a low value like 0.001 or similar.
