docker
======

Set of files to generate minimal docker containers for work with PostgreSQL.

mkimage-alpine.sh can be used  to create a base container image for Docker
using Alpine Linux. This script has been taken from docker-alpine at this
URL: https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine, and has been extended
to be able to build container images for ARM architectures, like Raspberry
PI machines. This script is made to detect the base image needed depending
on the system architecture where it is run.

Dockerfile_postgres can be used with the base image generated by the previous
script to generate a new container image that is completed with a set of
PostgreSQL binaries. It has been created to run on armv7l, still updating
it is trivial to make it run on other platforms, simply update the image
name generated previouly by the build script.

Dockerfile_dev will generate a minimalistic development environment to
work with Postgres.

With one of those Docker files, a container image can be created as follows:

    # Create container image named alpine-postgres-dev
    mkdir build
    cp Dockerfile_dev build/
    cd build
    docker build -t alpine-postgres-dev .

Then connect to it simply with something like that:

    docker run -t -i alpine-postgres-dev /bin/bash
