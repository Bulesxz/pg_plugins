pg_rep_state
============

Utility for monitoring status of backends regarding synchronous replication
by looking at the memory state of each backend and WAL receiver status.

The function in charge of reporting each backend status needs to hold
SyncRepLock while scanning all the existing backend entries so it may be
risky on a large array of backend entries.
