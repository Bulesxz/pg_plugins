pg_swap_pages
=============

This module is a PostgreSQL extension providing a basic set of features
using the generic WAL interface that has been generated in PostgreSQL
9.6.

As claims the name of this module, this can be used to register WAL
records that swap pages of a relation by generating WAL records doing
so, causing the target database to finish in a corrupted state. Hence
it is advised to refer to this module only as an example on how to use
the general WAL interface, and not in production.
